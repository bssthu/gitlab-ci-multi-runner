## The self-signed certificates or custom Certification Authorities

Since version 0.7.0 the GitLab Runner have allows to configure certificates that are used to verify TLS peer when connecting GitLab server.

**This allows to solve the `x509: certificate signed by unknown authority` problem when registering runner.**

The GitLab Runner provides these options:

1. **Default**: GitLab Runner reads system certificate store and verifies the GitLab server against the CA's stored in system.

2. GitLab Runner reads the PEM (**DER format is not supported**) certificate from predefined file:

        - `/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/hostname.crt` on *nix systems when gitlab-runner is executed as root.
        - `~/.gitlab-runner/certs/hostname.crt` on *nix systems when gitlab-runner is executed as non-root,
        - `./certs/hostname.crt` on other systems.

        If address of your server is: `https://my.gitlab.server.com:8443/`.
        Create the certificate file at: `/etc/gitlab-runner/certs/my.gitlab.server.com.crt`. 

3. GitLab Runner exposes `tls-ca-file` option during registration and in [`config.toml`](advanced-configuration.md)
which allows you to specify custom file with certificates. This file will be read everytime when runner tries to
access the GitLab server.

### Git cloning

The runner injects missing certificates to build CA chain to build containers.
This allows the `git clone` and `artifacts` to work with servers that do not use publicly trusted certificates.

This approach is secure, but makes the runner a single point of trust.
