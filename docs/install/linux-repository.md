### Install using official GitLab repositories

Currently we support Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS.

If you want to use Docker runner, install it before using the multi runner:

```bash
curl -sSL https://get.docker.com/ | sh
```

Add GitLab's official repository via apt-get or yum:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
curl -L https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/script.deb.sh | sudo bash

# For CentOS
curl -L https://packages.gitlab.com/install/repositories/runner/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
```

Install `gitlab-ci-multi-runner`:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get install gitlab-ci-multi-runner

# For CentOS
sudo yum install gitlab-ci-multi-runner
```

Register the runner:

```bash
sudo gitlab-ci-multi-runner register

Please enter the gitlab-ci coordinator URL (e.g. https://gitlab.com/ci )
https://gitlab.com/ci
Please enter the gitlab-ci token for this runner
xxx
Please enter the gitlab-ci description for this runner
my-runner
INFO[0034] fcf5c619 Registering runner... succeeded
Please enter the executor: shell, docker, docker-ssh, ssh?
docker
Please enter the Docker image (eg. ruby:2.1):
ruby:2.1
INFO[0037] Runner registered successfully. Feel free to start it, but if it's
running already the config should be automatically reloaded!
```

The runner should be started already and you are ready to build your projects!

Make sure that you read the [FAQ](../faq/README.md) section which describes
some of the most common problems with GitLab Runner.

### Update

Simply execute to install latest version:

```bash
# For Debian/Ubuntu
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gitlab-ci-multi-runner

# For CentOS
sudo yum update
sudo yum install gitlab-ci-multi-runner
```
