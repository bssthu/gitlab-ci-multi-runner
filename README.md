## GitLab Runner

Forked from https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/ .

This is the GitLab Runner repository, the official GitLab CI
runner written in Go. It runs tests and sends the results to GitLab CI.
[GitLab CI](https://about.gitlab.com/gitlab-ci) is the open-source
continuous integration server that coordinates the testing.

### Contributing

The official repository for this project is on [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner).

* [Development](docs/development/README.md)
* [Issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/issues)
* [Merge Requests](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ci-multi-runner/merge_requests)

### Requirements

**None:** gitlab-ci-multi-runner is run as a single binary.

This project is designed for the Linux, OS X and Windows operating systems.

If you want to use **Docker** make sure that you have **1.5.0** at least installed.

### Features

* Allows to run:
 - multiple jobs concurrently
 - use multiple tokens with multiple server (even per-project)
 - limit number of concurrent jobs per-token
* Jobs can be run:
 - locally
 - using Docker container
 - using Docker container and executing job over SSH
 - connecting to remote SSH server
* Is written in Go and distributed as single binary without any other requirements
* Supports Bash, Windows Batch and Windows PowerShell
* Works on Ubuntu, Debian, OS X and Windows (and anywhere you can run Docker)
* Allows to customize job running environment
* Automatic configuration reload without restart
* Easy to use setup with support for docker, docker-ssh, parallels or ssh running environments
* Enables caching of Docker containers
* Easy installation as service for Linux, OSX and Windows

### Version 0.5.0

Version 0.5.0 introduces many security related changes. 
One of such changes is the different location of `config.toml`.
Previously (prior 0.5.0) config was read from current working directory.
Currently, when `gitlab-runner` is executed by `root` or with `sudo` config is read from `/etc/gitlab-runner/config.toml`.
If `gitlab-runner` is executed by non-root user, the config is read from `$HOME/.gitlab-runner/config.toml`.
However, this doesn't apply to Windows where config is still read from current working directory, but this most likely will change in future.

The config file is automatically migrated when GitLab Runner was installed from GitLab's repository.
**For manual installations the config needs to be moved by hand.**
